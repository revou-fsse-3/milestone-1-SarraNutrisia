   ![Link Domain](images/readme/Beli_Domain_5_New%20-%20Copy.png)
    

## Connect Domain to Netlify ![Setting_DNS](images/readme/Setting_DNS.png)
The Domain Name System (DNS) turns domain names into IP addresses, which browsers use to load internet pages. Every device connected to the internet has its own IP address, which is used by other devices to locate the device.

1. Go to your Netlify account, choose your deploy site.
   
   ![Choose Site Deploy](images/readme/Connect_Netlify_Niagahoster_1.png)

2. Click Menu "Domain Management" to "Add a Domain" and verify your domain from Niagahoster to Netlify's deploy site. Previously, i have used the domain and now i also want to add subdomain from it, as follows.
   
   ![Add Domain](images/readme/Connect_Netlify_Niagahoster_2.png)

   ![Verify Domain](images/readme/Connect_Netlify_Niagahoster_3.png)

   ![Add Sub Domain](images/readme/Connect_Netlify_Niagahoster_4.png)
   
   
3. I had set up netlify DNS to domain on previous week. So now, I don't need to set up the DNS again. Just make sure the subdomain link it's working and has security on it. Then your subdomain address ready to use. Before that, please follow this step belows.
   
   ![Primary Domain](images/readme/Connect_Netlify_Niagahoster_5.png) 

   ![Check Security Domain](images/readme/Connect_Netlify_Niagahoster_6.png)

   ![Certificate Valid](images/readme/Connect_Netlify_Niagahoster_7.png)

    ![Add Domain to Netlify](images/readme/Connect_Netlify_Niagahoster_8.png)
